'''
Desc 足> A program with cubic running time. Read in N integers and counts the
number of triples that sum to exactly 0.

I/P 足> N number of integer, and N integer input array

Logic 足> Find distinct triples (i, j, k) such that a[i] + a[j] + a[k] = 0

O/P 足> One Output is number of distinct triplets as well as the second output is to
print the distinct triplets.
